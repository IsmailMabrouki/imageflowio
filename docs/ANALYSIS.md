# ImageFlowIO Library Analysis

## What is ImageFlowIO?

ImageFlowIO is a **config-driven ML inference pipeline library** for Node.js that allows developers to run machine learning models on images without writing procedural code. It provides a declarative approach to ML inference workflows through JSON configuration files, supporting image-to-image, classification, detection, and segmentation models.

### Core Concept

Instead of writing code like this:

```javascript
// Traditional approach - lots of procedural code
const image = await loadImage("input.jpg");
const resized = await resize(image, 512, 512);
const normalized = normalize(resized, [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
const tensor = convertToTensor(normalized);
const output = await model.predict(tensor);
const denormalized = denormalize(output, 255);
await saveImage(denormalized, "output.png");
```

You write a JSON config:

```json
{
  "model": { "path": "./model.onnx" },
  "preprocessing": {
    "resize": { "apply": true, "imageSize": [512, 512] },
    "normalize": {
      "apply": true,
      "mean": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
      "std": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
    }
  },
  "postprocessing": {
    "denormalize": { "apply": true, "scale": 255 }
  },
  "output": {
    "save": { "apply": true, "path": "./outputs", "format": "png" }
  }
}
```

And run it with:

```bash
imageflowio --config config.json --input image.jpg
```
